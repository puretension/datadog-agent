# Fix for Docker container size metrics not being collected when configured via autodiscovery
---
fixes:
  - |
    ``docker.container.size_rw`` and ``docker.container.size_rootfs``, which were previously ignored, are now sent when ``collect_container_size`` is enabled 
    through autodiscovery. 
    Previously, the ``collectContainerSize`` parameter was not passed to the ``runDockerCustom`` method, causing the size metrics to be 
    ignored regardless of the configuration setting.
